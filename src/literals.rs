//! Literal pools, and the other things a backend asks the core to do to a
//! section.
//!
//! `ldr r0, =0x12345678` loads a constant no instruction can hold, so the
//! assembler puts the constant in a pool of data near the code and assembles
//! a PC-relative load from it. The instruction is encoded as its statement
//! is read; the pool is written later, at `.ltorg` or at the end of the
//! section, and until then each use refers to its entry by a label that is
//! defined when the pool is written.
//!
//! Where entries go follows GNU as, whose rules the source that uses pools
//! was written against: one pool per section, collecting every literal since
//! the last `.ltorg`; an entry shared by every use of the same number, or of
//! the same symbol plus the same addend; and at most 1024 entries.
//!
//! The two GNU as ports that have pools lay them out differently, so a
//! backend says which it follows with [`Architecture::literal_pool`]:
//!
//! * [`LiteralPool::ByWidth`], AArch64's: a pool per entry width, written
//!   narrowest first, each run aligned to its own width with zeros rather
//!   than no-ops. A pool there holds four-, eight- and sixteen-byte entries.
//! * [`LiteralPool::Slots`], ARM's: one array of four-byte slots in the
//!   order the literals were asked for, where an eight-byte entry takes two
//!   slots and may need a padding slot in front of it; see
//!   [`Assembler::flush_literal_slots`].
//!
//! [`Architecture::literal_pool`]: crate::arch::Architecture::literal_pool
