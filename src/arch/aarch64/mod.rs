//! ARM 64-bit (A64). `EM_AARCH64`.
//!
//! A64 is fixed-width: every instruction is exactly four bytes, so this
//! backend always returns a single [`Variant`] and never asks the layout pass
//! to choose between encodings. What relaxation buys elsewhere, a fixup's
//! `value_bits` buys here — an out-of-range branch is a diagnostic rather than
//! a longer encoding, because there is no longer encoding.
//!
//! The other consequence of fixed width is that displacements never fit in one
//! contiguous field. Every PC-relative fixup therefore uses
//! [`crate::section::FieldEncoding::Scatter`] to weave its value through the
//! instruction word; the scatter functions live in [`encode`].
//!
//! # Two encoders
//!
//! The general-purpose instruction set is written out family by family in
//! [`insn`], where the interesting work is in the aliases. SIMD, floating
//! point and SVE are thousands of forms that differ in a few opcode bits, and
//! come from a table measured against llvm-mc; see the `table` module and
//! `tools/tables/README.md`. A line goes to the table if only the table has
//! its mnemonic, or if an operand is a register only a table form takes.
//!
//! # The `#` sigil
//!
//! A64 source conventionally writes immediates as `#imm`. `#` is a comment
//! only in the first column (see `comments` below), so both `add x0, x1,
//! #1` and the bare `add x0, x1, 1` that GNU as and llvm-mc also accept work.
