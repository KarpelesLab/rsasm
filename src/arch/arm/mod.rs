//! ARM 32-bit: the A32 (ARM) and T32 (Thumb) instruction sets. `EM_ARM`.
//!
//! The two instruction sets share a register file, a condition-code table and
//! an operand grammar, but not an encoding, so they share everything up to
//! [`Insn`] and then split into [`encode`] (A32) and [`thumb`] (T32). Which
//! one runs is a property of the *state*, not of the backend object: `.arm`
//! and `.thumb` switch between them mid-file, exactly as `.code32` and
//! `.code16` do on x86, and they are spelled that way too.
//!
//! The state's `bits` field carries the choice — 32 for ARM, 16 for Thumb —
//! because that is what `.code 16` and `.code 32` already mean in ARM sources.
//!
//! # Position-independent operands
//!
//! ARM writes the relocation a reference needs as a suffix in parentheses,
//! `sym(GOT)`, where the rest of the GNU syntax writes `sym@GOT`, and builds
//! a 32-bit address out of a `movw`/`movt` pair whose operands are written
//! `#:lower16:sym` and `#:upper16:sym`. GNU as reads the suffix in exactly
//! two places, and this backend reads it in the same two: in `.word` and
//! `.long`, which its `s_arm_elf_cons` handles, and on the target of a `b`,
//! `bl` or `blx`, whose operand type `parse_operands` gives a `parse_reloc`
//! call. A `(plt)` on a branch changes nothing about the object — GNU as
//! asks for `R_ARM_PLT32` and then writes the `R_ARM_CALL` or
//! `R_ARM_JUMP24` a plain branch would get, since a linker routes either
//! through a PLT entry when it needs one — so the suffix is accepted and the
//! branch is relocated as it always was.
//!
//! A `_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_` in a four-byte data field is `R_ARM_BASE_PREL`,
//! the distance from the field to the GOT, whether it was written as a
//! difference against a label or on its own; that is `md_apply_fix`'s rule,
//! and it is what makes `.word _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ - (1b + 8)` next to an
//! `add rn, pc, rn` load the GOT's address.
//!
//! # Thread-local operands
//!
//! The access models are data suffixes like the GOT ones: `(TLSGD)`,
//! `(TLSLDM)`, `(TLSLDO)`, `(GOTTPOFF)`, `(TPOFF)` and `(TLSDESC)`, each an
//! `R_ARM_TLS_*` relocation that names the variable rather than its section
//! and makes an undefined one `STT_TLS`. What a compiler writes adds the
//! distance from the `add rn, pc, rn` that uses the word,
//! `.word x(TLSGD) + (. - .LPIC0 - 8)`; that distance is a number once the
//! layout is known, and GNU as relocates `x` with it as the addend, not
//! PC-relative. The fields are `REL`, and GNU as fills two of them other than
//! with the addend alone; see `Arm::rel_field`.
//!
//! `(tlscall)` on a branch target is the call to a TLS descriptor's resolver,
//! `R_ARM_TLS_CALL` or `R_ARM_THM_TLS_CALL`, and leaves the branch's
//! displacement zero. `.tlsdescseq sym` marks the instruction after it, which
//! a linker may rewrite, with `R_ARM_TLS_DESCSEQ` or `R_ARM_THM_TLS_DESCSEQ`,
//! a relocation that covers none of its bits. GNU as also takes both as data
//! suffixes, `(TLSCALL)` and `(TLSDESCSEQ)`, and so does this backend.
//!
//! # Deliberate differences from GNU as
//!
//! GNU as is the reference for what this backend writes — its literal pools,
//! its mapping symbols and its interworking — but not for what it accepts.
//! Two things it refuses are assembled here, and llvm-mc, which writes the
//! same object rsasm does for both, is the reference for them instead.
//! A third is a field GNU as fills in differently, and wrongly.
//!
//! * A branch to a *local* label in another section that is an odd number of
//!   halfwords into Thumb code. GNU as's `arm_fix_adjustable` relocates such
//!   a reference against the label's section, folding the label's offset into
//!   the addend, and `md_apply_fix` then reads the low two bits of that
//!   addend as the branch destination's and stops with "misaligned branch
//!   destination" — although the offset it checked is not the branch's until
//!   a linker has placed both sections. rsasm names the label, as llvm-mc
//!   does (see `relocates_with_label` below), and leaves the whole reference
//!   to the linker, which has both addresses and the `blx` to reach Thumb
//!   with. The case is in `tools/mc-diff/arm-relocs.txt`.
//! * A literal pool entry holding a difference of labels, `ldr r0, =l1-l0`,
//!   where the difference is not already a number. GNU as's
//!   `parse_big_immediate` takes a constant, a bignum, or a symbol plus an
//!   addend, and a difference of two labels that the parser cannot fold is
//!   none of the three, so the line is a syntax error there; once the layout
//!   is known it is an ordinary number, and rsasm puts it in the pool. The
//!   case is in `tools/mc-diff/arm-programs.txt`.
//! * The offset of a T32 coprocessor transfer on coprocessor 9 with P set
//!   and W clear — `ldc p9, c1, [r0, #8]`, and every `ldc`, `stc` and label
//!   form of that shape. `md_apply_fix` tells the half-precision
//!   `vldr`/`vstr`, whose offset counts halfwords, from the word-counting
//!   rest by the finished word, `(newval & 0x0f200f00) == 0x0d000900`, which
//!   an `ldc` of coprocessor 9 matches as well; GNU as then writes half the
//!   field the architecture asks for, and accepts an offset that is only a
//!   multiple of two. The bytes it writes read back as a different address,
//!   so rsasm counts words, as llvm-mc does. The case is in
//!   `tools/mc-diff/thumb-programs.txt`.
//!
//! The relocation suffixes differ in what each assembler will read, rather
//! than in what either writes. `s_arm_elf_cons` strikes the suffix out of the
//! line and parses the rest again, so `.word sym(GOT) + 4` is `.word sym + 4`
//! relocated as a GOT entry; here the suffix binds to the symbol it follows,
//! which comes to the same relocation and addend for every expression either
//! assembler resolves, and differs only at the edges. `.word sym(PLT) + 4` is
//! a syntax error in GNU as, whose `(plt)` case emits the symbol and stops
//! reading, and is `.word sym + 4` here. `.4byte` and `.int` are plain
//! four-byte directives in GNU as, which gives the suffix only to `.word` and
//! `.long`, and take it here. A suffix GNU as knows but this backend has no
//! relocation for — `(TARGET1)`, `(TARGET2)`, `(SBREL)`, and the FDPIC ones,
//! which GNU as itself refuses outside an FDPIC object — is refused as
//! unrecognised. And `sym(GOT) - label` is refused, as is the difference with
//! any other suffix and `.tlsdescseq sym - label`: none of their relocations
//! has a PC-relative counterpart for the difference to become, and GNU as,
//! which makes the fixup PC-relative regardless, writes the field's own
//! address into the field.
