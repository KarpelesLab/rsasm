//! `.ARM.attributes`: what the object says about the CPU it was assembled
//! for, and the directives that change it.
//!
//! GNU as writes the section into every ARM object, and `objdump` reads it
//! to know which instruction set to disassemble against: without it an
//! `e12fff1e` prints as `msr SP_hyp, lr, lsl pc` rather than `bx lr`. The
//! tags are the EABI's, and the values are GNU as's for the CPU and the
//! floating-point unit selected — rsasm's ARM backend is `armv7ve` with
//! `neon-vfpv4`, which is what `tools/xas-diff` runs the reference as, so a
//! file with none of these directives in it gets what GNU as writes for that
//! command line: `Tag_CPU_name` `7VE`, `Tag_CPU_arch` 10 (ARMv7) with
//! profile `A`, the ARM and Thumb ISA tags, `Tag_FP_arch` 5 (VFPv4) with
//! `Tag_Advanced_SIMD_arch` 2, and the multiprocessing, divide and
//! virtualization tags ARMv7VE brings.
//!
//! # What is selected
//!
//! `.arch`, `.cpu`, `.fpu`, `.arch_extension` and `.object_arch` each change
//! one part of the selection, which is kept in [`ArchState::features`]: an
//! index into [`attr_data::ARCHS`] or [`attr_data::CPUS`], one into
//! [`attr_data::FPUS`], the extensions added since the last `.arch` as a
//! bitmask over that CPU's list, and the `.object_arch` override. Zero
//! everywhere is the backend's own CPU and unit.
//!
//! `.arch` and `.cpu` read tables that overlap without agreeing — `.arch
//! xscale` writes `Tag_CPU_name` `xscale` and `.cpu xscale` writes `XSCALE`
//! — and each forgets the extensions added to the CPU before it. `.fpu`
//! *replaces* every tag a unit decides, which is not what GNU as's `-mfpu=`
//! option does (that merges the unit with the CPU's own, so `-mcpu=cortex-x1
//! -mfpu=neon` keeps the ARMv8 unit where `.cpu cortex-x1` with `.fpu neon`
//! does not). `.object_arch` replaces `Tag_CPU_arch` and
//! `Tag_CPU_arch_profile` alone, and wins over an `.arch` either side of it.
//! `.eabi_attribute` replaces one tag outright, and is applied by the core
//! once the object is laid out; see [`Request::Attribute`].
//!
//! [`ArchState::features`]: crate::arch::ArchState::features
//! [`Request::Attribute`]: crate::arch::Request::Attribute
//!
//! # How the tags are put together
//!
//! `src/arch/arm/attr_data.rs` is measured from the reference by
//! `tools/tables/arm-attrs.py`, through the directives and under that
//! command line. A CPU with one unit, and a CPU with one extension, are
//! therefore exactly what GNU as writes, and the generator assembles every
//! such pair to prove it.
//!
//! Beyond that the answer is put together rather than measured, since GNU as
//! merges feature *bits* and derives the tags from the result, which is not
//! the same operation. Where two choices give one tag two values the larger
//! wins, except for `Tag_FP_arch`, whose `-d16` halves are numbered after the
//! units they are half of, and `Tag_Virtualization_use`, which is a pair of
//! bits. So a second `.arch_extension`, or one beside an `.fpu`, can differ
//! from GNU as; either directive on its own does not.
//!
//! `.arch_extension no<name>` is taken and changes nothing, which is what
//! GNU as 2.47 does with it: `-march=armv7ve` keeps `Tag_DIV_use` through
//! `.arch_extension noidiv`, and an `mp` the directive added survives
//! `.arch_extension nomp`.
//!
//! # Not modelled
//!
//! Which instructions a CPU has: `.arch armv4t` changes what the object says
//! and not what this backend assembles, where GNU as would refuse an ARMv7
//! instruction after it.
