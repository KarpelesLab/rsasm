//! Mach-O relocatable object output (`MH_OBJECT`), for x86-64, i386 and
//! arm64.
//!
//! Mach-O is not ELF with other numbers. Three things about it shape both
//! this writer and the few decisions the layout pass has to make differently
//! (all of them behind [`Format::MachO`](crate::output::Format::MachO)):
//!
//! * **Sections belong to segments, and a section is named by the pair.**
//!   `.text` is `__TEXT,__text`, and the source can name any pair with
//!   `.section __DATA,__foo`. All sections of an object share one nameless
//!   segment and one address space, so every section has an address here,
//!   unlike in a relocatable ELF object where each starts at zero.
//!
//! * **A relocation has no addend field.** What ELF puts in `r_addend` goes
//!   into the field being relocated, biased as each relocation type expects,
//!   and a difference of two symbols needs a `SUBTRACTOR`/`UNSIGNED` pair
//!   because one entry can only add. On arm64, where the fields are scattered
//!   through the instruction word and cannot hold an addend at all, the addend
//!   is a relocation of its own (`ARM64_RELOC_ADDEND`).
//!
//! * **Code is made of atoms.** A label whose name does not start with `L` is
//!   a *linker-visible* symbol, and the linker may move the code from it up to
//!   the next such label independently of everything around it. A reference
//!   that crosses from one atom into another therefore cannot be resolved
//!   here, however close the two are and whether or not the target is global;
//!   it is relocated against the target's atom, with the distance from the
//!   atom carried as the addend. That is what the `Atoms` table below is for,
//!   and it is why a Mach-O object has relocations where an ELF one has none.
//!
//! What is written: one `LC_SEGMENT_64` with every section; the deployment
//! target where the target triple or the source gave one, as
//! `LC_BUILD_VERSION` or the older `LC_VERSION_MIN_*`;
//! `LC_DATA_IN_CODE` where it marked data in code;
//! `LC_SYMTAB` with `LC_DYSYMTAB`, whose three-way split of the symbol table
//! is required, not optional, unless there are no symbols at all, and which
//! points at the indirect symbol table `.indirect_symbol` fills; and one
//! `LC_LINKER_OPTION` per `.linker_option`.
//!
//! As far as llvm-mc 22 writes the same object, rsasm writes it byte for
//! byte, down to the order of the symbols and the string table's shared
//! tails; `tools/macho-diff` checks that.
//!
//! The debugging sections that `-g`, `.loc` and `.cfi_*` make are written here
//! as well, in a `__DWARF` segment and in `__TEXT,__eh_frame`. Because every
//! section already has an address, most of what an ELF object relocates is a
//! number here; see the `dwarf` module. A frame is also described by one word
//! in `__LD,__compact_unwind`, which the linker reads in preference to the
//! frame table: always on arm64, and on x86-64 where the deployment target
//! is a macOS whose linker read one; see `CompactUnwind` and `Deployment`.
